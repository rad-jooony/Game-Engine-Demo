Game Prototype + Engine | v0.20 | 11/01/2023

ENGINE

Current Functionality
---------------------

Engine has the functionality to create sprites, link entities to them and dispaly them on screen. 

Assigning a faction to each entity will allow then to be checked for collision in different ways




Milestone 2 | v0.11 | 27/10/2022

New Functionality
-----------------

Added loading/drawing, passes errors for unsuccessful loading and there should be no memory leaks.
player sprite movement, player cannost pass or clip into the screen
players movement is slowed when moving diagonally


Code Additions
--------------
started moving into classes, though functions are currently limited to clearing the screen
drawing alpha values is relatively optimised

Tests
----- 
purposfully not loading textures does lead to an error. Memory allocation is deleted before closing the program


Notes
-----
Star simulation isn't functional currently, nor is it very good.
perhaps adding a 'horrid pink' texture in place of textures that are unsuccessfully loading would be a good idea

Milestone 1 | v0.10 | 13/10/2022
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

Added star field, stars have trails that follow them.
Added control of eye distance using up and down arrows.

Code Additions
--------------

Error notifications for any changes beyond the screen buffer array when stars reach the edge of the screen or Z-axis.
Functions
	- RefreshScreen(); - Allows me to work on how the screen refreshes even when there are multipul instances of the function within the program

Tests
-----

Can draw stars up to maximum array size, switching to vectors or lists can increase this value dramatically.

Notes
-----

maybe next adding classes, and increasing size of stars as they approach. adding more control such as star speed.
