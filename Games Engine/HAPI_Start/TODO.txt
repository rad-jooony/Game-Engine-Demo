1 - link the player and the sprite classes properly, assinging the player 
to a sprite should allow access to that sprites variables for use in functions

2 - Figure out how to use a recangle in another class. Im not really sure how it works

3 - use both of these functionalities to allow objects to clip out the screen but keep the player within the bounds

----

Currently the inputs dont seem to work properly now that the function for movment is in the player class
